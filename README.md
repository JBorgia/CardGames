# CardGames

Java based project for card games. Currently, only menu and BlackJack are completed. Card and deck objects were constructed so the project can be scaled to allow for additional games to be added in the future. The project uses abstract classes and heredity to populate the table object with players and dealer. Additional calculations were built in to allow user to change settings and for Ace 1 or 11 calculation (ace calculation is performed automatically).
